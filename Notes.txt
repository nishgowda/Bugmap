LOOK UP:
Multiple users on site cannot share the same database. Nested databses then?

You must start your MySQL server and log into it by selecting your databse.
MySQL command to access databse: /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql -uroot -p

IDEAS:
    Search command for issues (look through static overflow for potential solutions)
    - Auto detect bugs from comiler in terminal...
